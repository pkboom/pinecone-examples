For\\narti\\x0ccial systems, however, this is still di\\x0ecult, due to viewpoint-dependent object variability,\\nand the high in-class variability of many object types. Deep hierarchical neural models roughly\\nmimick the nature of mammalian visual cortex, and by community consensus are among the most\\npromising architectures for such tasks.

Filter', 'promising architectures for such tasks. The most successful hierarchical object recognition systems\\nall extract localized features from input images, convolving image patches with \\x0clters. Filter\\nresponses are then repeatedly sub-sampled and re-\\x0cltered, resulting in a deep feed-forward network\\narchitecture whose output feature vectors are eventually classi\\x0ced. One of the \\x0crst hierarchical\\nneural systems was the Neocognitron (Fukushima, 1980) which inspired many of the more recent\\nvariants.\\nUnsupervised learning methods applied to patches of natural images tend to produce localized\\n\\x0clters that resemble o\\x0b-center-on-surround \\x0clters, orientation-sensitive bar detectors, Gabor \\x0clters\\n(Schmidhuber et al. , 1996; Olshausen and Field, 1997; Hoyer and Hyv\\x7f arinen, 2000). These \\x0cndings\\nin conjunction with experimental studies of the visual cortex justify the use of such \\x0clters in the\\nso-called standard model for object recognition (Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999; Serre et al. , 2007;\\nMutch and Lowe, 2008), whose \\x0clters are \\x0cxed, in contrast to those of Convolutional Neural', 'Mutch and Lowe, 2008), whose \\x0clters are \\x0cxed, in contrast to those of Convolutional Neural\\nNetworks (CNNs) (LeCun et al. , 1998; Behnke, 2003; Simard et al. , 2003), whose weights (\\x0clters)\\nare randomly initialized and changed in a supervised way using back-propagation (BP).\\nDespite the hardware progress of the past decades, computational speed is still a limiting\\nfactor for CNN architectures characterized by many building blocks typically set by trial and\\nerror. To systematically test the impact of various architectures on classi\\x0ccation performance,\\nwe present a fast CNN implementation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Previous GPU\\nimplementations of CNNs (Chellapilla et al. , 2006; Uetz and Behnke, 2009) were hard-coded to\\nsatisfy GPU hardware constraints, whereas our implementation is \\rexible and fully online (i.e.,\\nTechnical Report No. IDSIA-01-11 2\\nweight updates after each image). It allows for training large CNNs within days instead of months,\\nsuch that we can investigate the in\\ruence of various structural parameters by exploring large\\nparameter spaces (Pinto et al. , 2009) and performing error analysis on repeated experiments.\\nWe evaluate various networks on the handwritten digit benchmark MNIST (LeCun et al. , 1998)', 'We evaluate various networks on the handwritten digit benchmark MNIST (LeCun et al. , 1998)\\nand two image classi\\x0ccation benchmarks: NORB (LeCun et al. , 2004) and CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky,\\n2009).\\n2 Convolutional neural networks\\nCNNs are hierarchical neural networks whose convolutional layers alternate with subsampling\\nlayers, reminiscent of simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex (Wiesel and Hubel,\\n1959). CNNs vary in how convolutional and subsampling layers are realized and how the nets\\nare trained. The CNN architecture considered in this study di\\x0bers from the one of Simard et al.\\n(2003) in the sense that after each CNN-layer an optional max-pooling layer (Scherer et al. , 2010)\\ncan be used. Here we give a complete description of this independent implementation (Fig. 1).\\n2.1 Image processing layer\\nThe image processing layer is an optional pre-processing layer of prede\\x0cned \\x0clters that are kept\\n\\x0cxed during training.
