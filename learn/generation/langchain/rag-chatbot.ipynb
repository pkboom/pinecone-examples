      "Llama 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) developed in a work. These LLMs range in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. They are optimized specifically for dialogue use cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes Llama 2 special is that its fine-tuned LLMs, such as L/l.sc/a.sc/m.sc/a.sc /two.taboldstyle-C/h.sc/a.sc/t.sc, have shown better performance compared to existing open-source chat models on various benchmarks. They have also been evaluated in terms of helpfulness and safety, and they appear to be on par with some closed-source models.\n",
      "\n",
      "This work aims to provide a detailed description of the approach used for fine-tuning and ensuring safety in Llama 2, similar to other closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. The closed-source LLMs are extensively fine-tuned to align with human preferences, enhancing their usability and safety. However, this fine-tuning process often involves significant costs in terms of computation and human annotation, and it is not always transparent or easily reproducible, which can limit progress in AI alignment research within the community.\n",

      "In summary, Llama 2 offers pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs optimized for dialogue use cases, outperforming open-source chat models on benchmarks and potentially serving as substitutes for closed-source models in terms of helpfulness and safety.\n"
